# Context

## Reconstruction of 3D buildings

::: {.incremental}
- Many applications of 3D buildings: visualization, simulations, solar potential, etc.
- Different levels of detail required
:::

::: {.notes}
- Visualization -> multiple levels of details for different distances
- Simulations -> simple models for quicker computations
- Solar potential -> care about the roofs mostly
- Tax estimation -> care about the floor space mostly
:::

## Levels of detail

![Visual example of the refined LoDs for a residential building [@Biljecki2016].](../../images/LoDs_illustration-Filip_Biljecki.jpg){.r-stretch}

::: {.notes}
- Differentiation between footprints and roofprints is the required step to go from LoD 2.2 to 2.3.
- Definitions of footprints and roofprints are not always straightforward.
:::

## 3DBAG example

## French context

::: {.incremental}
- [BD TOPO](https://geoservices.ign.fr/bdtopo): building outlines in France
- [LiDAR HD](https://www.ign.fr/institut/programme-lidar-hd-vers-une-nouvelle-cartographie-3d-du-territoire): first nationwide ALS LiDAR dataset of France
- [Jumeau numérique de la France](https://www.ign.fr/institut/un-jumeau-numerique-de-la-france-pour-piloter-la-transition-ecologique): future digital twin of France
:::

::: {.notes}
- BD TOPO:
    - Contains building outlines with poor georeferencing
- LiDAR HD:
    - The first project to collect high-density point clouds on the whole territory of France
    - Similar nature and density to the AHN used for the 3DBAG
:::

## What about façade points?

::: {.fragment}
- ALS point clouds give high density of points on roofs and low density on façades
:::

**_What characteristics of ALS point clouds influence the ability to generate accurate building roofprints and footprints?_**
:::

::: {.notes}
- We know that roof points can be used to reconstruct buildings, with a limitation to LoD 2.2
- Can we use façade points?
- Sub-questions:
    - Point cloud acquisition (geometry of the scanning device, trajectory of the flying vehicle)
    - Differences obtained between footprints and roofprints
    - Potential usage of existing shifted outlines
:::

# Research context

## Roof overhangs

::: {.incremental}
- Sweeping vertical planes:
    - Using a 2.5D DSM and a footprint [@Dahlke2015; @Frommholz2017]
    - Using a point cloud and a roofprint [@Panday2012]
- Extending the roof planes [@Goebbels2023]

## Point cloud semantic segmentation

::: {.incremental}
- Range-images as input [@Biasutti2019; @Xu2020]
- 3D convolutions (KPConv, PointTransformerv3, etc) [@Thomas2019; @Li2020; @Zhao2020; @Wu2023]
- Class imbalance [@Li2024; @Pan2025]
:::

::: {.notes}
- Range-images:
    - Represent the 3D points clouds in 2D by looking at them from the viewpoint of the sensor, which often scans point clouds in lines with almost uniform angular steps.
    - Useful for speed
- 3D convolutions:
    - KPConv: weights carried by points correlated with the neighbourhoods
    - PointTransformer: transformer for points using self-attention
    - PointTransformerv3: serialization of points with space-filling curves
- Class imbalance: deal with sparse and inhomogeneous annotations

List of point cloud datasets for semantic segmentation of point clouds.

# Methodology

## Overview

1. Train a machine learning model to isolate roof and façade points
2. Use the segmented point cloud to compute roofprints
3. Use the segmented point cloud and the roofprints to compute footprints
4. Evaluate the method with generated data and hopefully real data

## Semantic segmentation

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
1. Generate a ground-truth dataset using 3DBAG and AHN4
    1. Download all data per tiles,
    2. Extend the roofs of buildings with fake overhangs,
    3. Compute the distances of each point to the set of roofs and to the set of façades,
    4. Classify the points based on these distances between roof, façade and other.
2. Train a ML model on the data:
    1. Try different models (PointTransformerv3, KPConv, etc)
    2. Select and run the best one

Example of classifying the AHN 4 with the 3DBAG.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
- 3DBAG is based on AHN3 + AHN4
:::

## Roofprints

- The method still needs to be determined
- It will depend on the results of semantic segmentation

## Footprints

- Sweep vertical planes parallel to the roofprint edges
- Identify the best one or none at all
- Potential to use symmetry of roofs

## Assessment

::: {.incremental}
- Create a fake ground-truth dataset:
    - Create a fake LoD 2.3 dataset from 3DBAG LoD 2.2 by randomly extending the roof planes
    - Simulate an ALS point cloud with tools such as [HELIOS++](https://github.com/3dgeo-heidelberg/helios)
- Evaluate the method on this dataset
- Some annotations of real data for better assessment?
:::

# Current and future work

## Until now

::: {.incremental}
- Literature review
- Explored French and Dutch datasets and their metadata
- Started the work on classifying AHN 4 using 3DBAG
:::

## From now on
