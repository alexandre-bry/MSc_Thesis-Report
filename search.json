Here are some examples of buildings where defining them is not easy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D model from Sketchfab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D model from Sketchfab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D model from Sketchfab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D model from Sketchfab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D model from Sketchfab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D model from Sketchfab\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Several models of realistic buildings where the roofprint and footprint are harder to define.\n\n\n\n\nIn BD TOPO, the definitions are the following.\n\nFor the buildings coming from the BD PARCELLAIRE:\n\nLa forme du contour est prise au sol. Le polygone est aplati c’est-à-dire que l’on affecte à chaque point du bâtiment unifié la même altitude toit (comme une « boîte à chaussures »). &gt; The shape of the outline is taken from the ground. The polygon is flattened, i.e. each point of the unified building is assigned the same roof height (like a ‘shoebox’).\n\nTranslated to English:\n\nThe shape of the outline is taken from the ground. The polygon is flattened, i.e. each point of the unified building is assigned the same roof height (like a ‘shoebox’).\n\nFor the buildings derived from photogrammetric restitution processes or captured on orthophotography:\n\nContour extérieur du bâtiment tel qu’il apparaît vu d’avion (le plus souvent, ce contour correspond à celui du toit); altitude correspondant à ce contour (généralement l’altitude des gouttières). Seules les cours intérieures de plus de 10 m de large sont représentées par un trou dans la surface bâtie.\n\nTranslated to English:\n\nOuter contour of the building as seen from the air (in most cases, this contour corresponds to the roof); altitude corresponding to this contour (usually the height of the gutters). Only inner courtyards wider than 10 m are represented by a hole in the built-up area.\n\n\nThe Merged Approved Documents (from UK Building Regulations):\n\nDefinition from Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition, page 112\n\nThe footprint of the building is the maximum aggregate plan perimeter found by the vertical projection of any overhanging storey onto a ground storey\n\nApproved Document O, 2021 edition, page 6 mentions that to provide shading in “high risk location”, one solution is using\n\nOverhangs with 50 degrees altitude cut-off on due south-facing façades only\n\n\nINSPIRE D2.8.III.2 Data Specification on Buildings – Technical Guidelines has these examples:\n\n\n\nExample of building footprint and roofprint\n\n\nThis page from Law Insider gathers definitions of building footprints, with the second one being quite detailed:\n\nBuilding footprint means the horizontal area as seen in plan, measured from outside of all exterior walls and supporting columns. It includes dwellings and any area of attached garage that exceeds 200 square feet. It does not include detached garages or carports; accessory structures; trellises; patios; areas of porch, deck, and balcony less than 30 inches from finished grade; cantilevered covers, porches or projections; or ramps and stairways required for access.\n\nAn other different but interesting definition is:\n\nBuilding footprint means the two-dimensional configuration of an existing building’s perimeter boundaries as measured on a horizontal plane at ground level.\n\nor simply:\n\nBuilding footprint means the outline of a building, as measured around its foundation.\n\n\nThese two articles here and there explain that roof overhangs server mainly three purposes: - Protects materials against rain, snow and sunlight - Protects materials against UVs - Prevents overheating in summer The first one also provides a simple way to compute the roof overhang to protect from humidity or sun.\n\n\nA1 presentation\n\nWhat is the focus, the goal of the A1 presentation?\nWho will be there?\nShould I assume everyone read the project proposal?",
