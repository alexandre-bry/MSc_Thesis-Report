# MSc Thesis - Website

Author: Alexandre Bry

This repository contains the notes taken during my MSc Thesis with TU Delft and the IGN (*Institut national de l’information géographique et forestière*) from November 2025 to June 2026.
It also contains the source of the reports and slides made during the project.
Everything is published at: <https://alexandre-bry.github.io/MSc_Thesis-Report/>.

The current organization of the repository is the following:

```tree
.
├── 404.html
├── index.qmd
├── _quarto.yml
├── README.md
├── references/
│   └── MSc_Thesis-Bibliography.bib
└── weekly_notes/
```

The website can be very easily published by running `quarto publish gh-pages --no-prompt`.
