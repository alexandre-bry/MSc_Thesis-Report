## Previous week

### Organise my notes

- I created this repository to store and share my notes easily.
- I will also use it to make slides/reports, so this will centralise most of the information I gather and make it easier to reuse it.

### Get access to a cluster to train ML models

- Jean Zay used by the IGN won't be available to me until my internship at the IGN officially starts
- TU Delft has [DAIC](https://daic.tudelft.nl/docs/system/compute-nodes/) and [DelftBlue](https://doc.dhpc.tudelft.nl/delftblue/DHPC-hardware/), DAIC being probably the most promising since focussed on AI.
I started talking with people at TU Delft to get access but don't have access yet.

### Create our own point cloud dataset with AHN and 3DBAG

- Looked at @Merizette2025 which explains how they created a new dataset for semantic segmentation of indoor TLS with two different processes: manual labelling and automatic generation of pseudo-labels from a BIM model of the objects.
- Looked at the coherence between the LoD 2.2 buildings from 3DBAG with the AHN4 point cloud in the center of Delft.
Most points in the dataset seem to be close and accurate, with different precision depending on the case:
    - Roof points are mostly close to the building with 0.1 m precision
    - For façades there is more variation, but mostly up to 0.5 m,
    - Then there are more complex situations like balconys, chimneys and other details that are not represented in the 3DBAG and are therefore further away
    - Monuments (such as churches and fancy buildings) and new buildings also give bad results

Two examples of the coherence between the 3DBAG and the AHN4.
