## Previous week

- Looked for articles about roofprint / footprint differentiation but didn't really find anything
- Started looking at a few articles about roofprint / footprint from LiDAR

## Discussion

- LiDARHD of IGN is already classified but there is no separation of façades and roofs
- BAG + BGT + AHN4 could maybe be used to train a model
- CloudCompare is nice to visualise point clouds

## Next week

- Look for articles about point cloud classification, especially roof/façades, because façades are not classified by default and are a rare class (tail distribution)
- Look at point cloud semantic segmentation methods:
    - [KPConv](https://github.com/HuguesTHOMAS/KPConv-PyTorch)
    - MinkowskiNet
    - PointTransformer
