## Previous week

- Looked at more articles about roofprint / footprint from LiDAR
- The keywords footprint and roofprint don't seem really popular, but there are much more articles talking about "outline", which in the case of aerial data seems to mean footprint
- Looked at a few articles about point cloud semantic segmentation

## Discussion

- Being able to use the direction of the LiDAR scan could be an interesting topic

## Next week

- Look at other papers:
    - [Semantic3D](https://semantic3d.ethz.ch/)
    - Tail distribution classification
    - Bird's eye view, projection for classification
    - Process point clouds in 2D: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08748>
