## Discussion

- At least a full week on literature review would be beneficial
- JabRef can be a great tool

## Next week

- Look for:
    - Roofprint / footprint differentiation (probably not much)
    - Extraction of roofprint / footprint from point clouds
    - Point cloud semantic segmentation
- For the literature review:
    - <perplexity.ai> can be great to start
    - Then use internet, especially Google Scholar is nice
    - Look for new articles by searching for articles that cite interesting articles or were cited by interesting articles
    - Write a small summary of every article I read with the things to remember, even if I don't understand anything
    - Try to structure / categorise the methods I find
