## Previous week results

- Improved the project proposal based on the feedback, and put it on this website [there](../reports/Project_proposal.qmd)
- Looked in more details into the definitions of footprint and roofprint

## Material for discussion

### Definitions of footprints and roofprints

How could we define the footprints and roofprints more precisely?
Here are some examples of buildings where defining them is not easy:

Several models of realistic buildings where the roofprint and footprint are harder to define.
:::

- In BD TOPO, the definitions are the following.
    - For the buildings coming from the BD PARCELLAIRE:

        > La forme du contour est prise au sol.
        > Le polygone est aplati c’est-à-dire que l’on affecte à chaque point du bâtiment unifié la même altitude toit (comme une « boîte à chaussures »).    > The shape of the outline is taken from the ground.
        > The polygon is flattened, i.e. each point of the unified building is assigned the same roof height (like a ‘shoebox’).


        Translated to English:

        > The shape of the outline is taken from the ground.
        > The polygon is flattened, i.e. each point of the unified building is assigned the same roof height (like a ‘shoebox’).

    - For the buildings derived from photogrammetric restitution processes or captured on orthophotography:

        > Contour extérieur du bâtiment tel qu’il apparaît vu d’avion (le plus souvent, ce contour correspond à celui du toit); altitude correspondant à ce contour (généralement l’altitude des gouttières).
        > Seules les cours intérieures de plus de 10 m de large sont représentées par un trou dans la surface bâtie.

        Translated to English:

        > Outer contour of the building as seen from the air (in most cases, this contour corresponds to the roof); altitude corresponding to this contour (usually the height of the gutters).
        > Only inner courtyards wider than 10 m are represented by a hole in the built-up area.
- [The Merged Approved Documents](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-regulations-and-approved-documents-index#approved-documents) (from UK Building Regulations):
    - Definition from Approved Document B Volume 2, 2019 edition, page 112

        > The footprint of the building is the maximum aggregate plan perimeter found by the vertical projection of any overhanging storey onto a ground storey

    - Approved Document O, 2021 edition, page 6 mentions that to provide shading in "high risk location", one solution is using

        > Overhangs with 50 degrees altitude cut-off on due south-facing façades only

- INSPIRE [D2.8.III.2 Data Specification on Buildings – Technical Guidelines](https://inspire-mif.github.io/technical-guidelines/data/bu/dataspecification_bu.pdf) has these examples:

    ![Example of building footprint and roofprint](./2026_01_19/Geometric_representations_INSPIRE.png){width=60%}


- This [page from Law Insider](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/building-footprint) gathers definitions of building footprints, with the second one being quite detailed: 

    > Building footprint means the horizontal area as seen in plan, measured from outside of all exterior walls and supporting columns.
    > It includes dwellings and any area of attached garage that exceeds 200 square feet.
    > It does not include detached garages or carports; accessory structures; trellises; patios; areas of porch, deck, and balcony less than 30 inches from finished grade; cantilevered covers, porches or projections; or ramps and stairways required for access.

    An other different but interesting definition is:

    > Building footprint means the two-dimensional configuration of an existing building's perimeter boundaries as measured on a horizontal plane at ground level.

    or simply:

    > Building footprint means the outline of a building, as measured around its foundation.

These two articles [here](https://www.pathnet.org/sp_id_14037/) and [there](https://spenglerindustries.com/the-importance-of-roof-overhangs-why-german-building-practices-lead-the-way/) explain that roof overhangs server mainly three purposes:
    - Protects materials against rain, snow and sunlight
    - Protects materials against UVs
    - Prevents overheating in summer
The first one also provides a simple way to compute the roof overhang to protect from humidity or sun.

### A1 presentation

- What is the focus, the goal of the A1 presentation?
- Who will be there?
- Should I assume everyone read the project proposal? 

## Discussion



## Next week

- [ ] Prepare the A1 presentation
